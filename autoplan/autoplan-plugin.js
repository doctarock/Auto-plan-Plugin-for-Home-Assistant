/**
 * Plugin Name: Autoplan
 * Plugin Slug: autoplan
 * Description: Decision automation for worker agents. Injects six core decision principles
 *              into worker task prompts to auto-resolve common intermediate questions
 *              (completeness, DRY, explicit over clever, etc.). Also provides a tool for
 *              workers to explicitly invoke autoplan reasoning on a specific decision.
 *              Inspired by gstack's autoplan decision engine.
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Author: OpenClaw Observer
